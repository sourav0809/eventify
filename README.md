# Evently ðŸŒƒ

Evently is a responsive web application that allows authenticated users to view events based on their tier (Free, Silver, Gold, Platinum). Users can only see events that are available to their tier or lower. Built with modern web technologies, Evently provides a clean and intuitive interface for browsing tier-based events.
